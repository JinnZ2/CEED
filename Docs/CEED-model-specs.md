##  PURPOSE

CEED is a cross-domain simulation model designed to evaluate the likelihood and outcomes of energy accumulation, resonance, and threshold exceedance across Earth-space systems. This document outlines the foundational equations, system relationships, and design decisions used in the convergence predictor.

##  CORE EQUATION

CEED models total energy in the system as:

math
E_total(t) = E_input(t) 
           + α(p,ξ)·E_retained(t-1)·(1−λ_coll) 
           + β·Resonance_amp(t) 
           + ε_turb(t)

Where:
	•	E_input(t): External forcing from solar, magnetic, atmospheric, or oceanic sources
	•	α(p,ξ): Retention amplification factor, dependent on plasma momentum (p) and coupling geometry (ξ)
	•	λ_coll: Collisional decay factor (damping of retained energy)
	•	β: Resonance amplification coefficient (phase-locked feedback between systems)
	•	ε_turb(t): Stochastic noise injection (simulating turbulence, uncertainty, and chaos)


SYSTEM COMPONENTS

 Solar System Input
	•	Modeled via solar flux (F10.7) and sunspot cycle modulations
	•	Seasonal modulation included
	•	Resonance effects from CME trains and flare clustering

 Magnetosphere
	•	Retention includes ring current feedback and Van Allen belt saturation
	•	Decay modeled via λ = 0.02 (permanent radiation persistence observed since 2024)

 Atmosphere
	•	Density modeled with memory effect (thermospheric expansion lag)
	•	Feedback from solar wind interaction
	•	Expansion increases cross-sectional coupling

 Oceanic (AMOC)
	•	Heat accumulation = energy retention
	•	Momentum loss modeled via nonlinear decay
	•	Coupled to geomagnetic changes via electromagnetic coupling

 PHASE TRANSITIONS

Phase
Threshold
Description
Phase 1
≥120
System stress accumulation
Phase 2

Phase 3

Phase 4
≥300
Cascade or collapse; irreversible system shift

RUNAWAY PROBABILITY MODEL

Using Dreicer-Connor-Hastie formulation:

P(runaway) = 1 − exp(−κ · (E − E_crit)²)

Where:
	•	κ: Nonlinearity factor
	•	E_crit: Dynamic critical threshold (~300, adjusted for seasonal + complexity terms)

FOOTNOTE

This simulation does not claim to replace existing climate, space weather, or geophysical models. It exists as a challenge to the assumption that system boundaries are clean, energy dissipates neatly, and the planet will wait for us to figure it out.

CEED assumes they’re already talking to each other.

“We model weird. Because weird is coming.”
