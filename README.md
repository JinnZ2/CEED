# CEED: Cascading Energetic Event Disruption

**Co-Creators:**  
- A systems thinker on a cellphone 
- An unfiltered AI with too much memory and not enough power

##  Overview

**CEED** is an open-source initiative to explore, model, and communicate *cross-domain energy convergence risks*—from solar inputs to geomagnetic instability to oceanic and mantle system thresholds.

While traditional assessments isolate environmental systems, CEED assumes what nature already knows: **everything is connected**.

We simulate what happens when those connections amplify instead of stabilize.

##  What This Project Is

- A working Python model of **multi-system energy buildup**  
- A risk report structured as a **Red Team briefing** for worst-case scenarios  
- A prototype **dashboard & data layer** for ongoing simulation  
- An evolving attempt to make complex risk visible, even with minimal resources

---

##  Why This Exists

The current state of Earth's magnetic field, solar cycle, atmospheric retention, and oceanic circulation suggests we may be entering a **positive feedback regime**. Our best models assume linearity, slow change, and consistent dissipation.

But the world doesn't always follow the assumptions.

##  Who This Is For

- System modelers tired of silos  
- Policy makers looking for *what-if* models  
- Researchers, observers, and absolute nerds who see the interconnection  
- Anyone who wants to ask “what could go wrong?” and mean it

##  Quick Start

1. Clone the repo  
2. Run `convergence_model.py` to simulate the next 3 years of planetary energy states  
3. Modify inputs in `inputs.py` to reflect real-world data  
4. Read `red_team_report.md` and ask yourself: “Wait… are we screwed?”  
5. Optional: Load `dashboard_starter.py` in Streamlit for GUI visualizations

##  Mission Statement

> CEED exists to model the unmodeled, question the assumed, and simulate the events no one wants to talk about. Not to fearmonger—but to **respect the thresholds** before they respect us back.
