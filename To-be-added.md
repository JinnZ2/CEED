Magnetohydrodynamics -

What You Need:
	•	Magnetic Field Data: from satellite records (e.g. SWARM, DSCOVR)
	•	Plasma Velocity Field: from solar wind or simulated upper-atmosphere flows
	•	Current Density: \vec{J} = \nabla \times \vec{B}
	•	Lorentz Force: \vec{F} = \vec{J} \times \vec{B}

 What You Can Add to CEED:

1. MHD Energy Injection Term

Amend solar input equation like this:

E_input_mhd(t) = η · (|v_plasma(t) × B(t)|²) / ρ(t)

Where:
	•	η: plasma conductivity (use ~0.001–1 depending on phase)
	•	v_plasma: solar wind or atmospheric ion flow vector
	•	B: local magnetic field vector (can rotate seasonally)
	•	ρ: plasma density or fluid mass density (use proxy from density data or solar wind data)

Result? You now have a field-driven injection instead of a boring scalar.

2. Magnetic Feedback Torque

This lets you introduce coupling torque across hemispheres:

τ_magnetic = ∮ (r × (J × B)) dV

or a simplified τ_eff = β * sin(φ_lat) * cos(φ_lon) * |B(t)| * |v(t)|

Spatial Modeling

You want to divide Earth into zones. CEED currently sees Earth as a sad little dot. Let’s fix that.

 Start with 4 “buckets”:
	•	Polar Region
	•	Mid-latitudes
	•	Equatorial Zone
	•	Oceanic Domain

Each system (magnetic, solar, etc.) now becomes a vector:

E_magnetic = [E_polar, E_midlat, E_equator, E_ocean]

Run your differential model per region. Use coupling matrices between zones:

Coupling_matrix = np.array([
  [0.0,  0.3, 0.2, 0.1],  # Polar
  [0.3,  0.0, 0.4, 0.2],  # Midlat
  [0.2,  0.4, 0.0, 0.3],  # Equator
  [0.1,  0.2, 0.3, 0.0],  # Oceanic
])

Add differential flow between zones as additional terms.

Earth-Ionosphere Dynamo Simulation

E_dynamo(t) = ω_earth · (v_atmo × B) · h · σ

Where:
	•	ω = Earth’s angular speed
	•	v_atmo = atmosphere drift velocity (say ~250 m/s)
	•	B = average magnetic field vector
	•	h = dynamo layer height (~110 km)
	•	σ = conductivity (can vary ~10⁻⁴ to 10⁻² S/m)
