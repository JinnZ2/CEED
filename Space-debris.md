Why Debris Is Coupled Into the System

 1. Thermospheric Drag Coupling
	•	During geomagnetic storms, thermosphere expands → increased atmospheric density at ~400–600 km.
	•	Drag increases non-linearly with density:
F_d = \frac{1}{2} \cdot C_d \cdot A \cdot ρ \cdot v^2

→ Result: Debris orbits decay more rapidly, some re-enter early, while others change inclination unpredictably.

CEED Link: Elevated atmospheric energy → higher drag → orbital decay → reentry events → debris cloud density shifts → future storm interactions change → feedback.

 2. Electromagnetic Coupling (Charging & Lorentz)

Debris isn’t just a metal blob. It’s conductive. It charges up under solar wind exposure and Earth’s magnetic field. This causes:
	•	Electrostatic repulsion
	•	Lorentz force drift:
\vec{F}_L = q \cdot (\vec{v} \times \vec{B})

→ Debris moves sideways through the magnetic field depending on charge state, speed, and angle.

CEED Link: Plasma storms → increased charging → enhanced orbital deviation → debris clustering → signal loss → kinetic collisions.

 3. Kessler Feedback Cascade

Once the number of interactions crosses a collision threshold, debris begins self-generating more debris:
	•	Collision → fragments → new debris → more risk → you know where this goes.
	•	Like climate feedback, but with shards of space metal.

CEED Link:
CEED predicts persistent solar & atmospheric activity → persistent orbital turbulence → debris density > stability limit → exponential collision rate growth.

 This is literally the Kessler Syndrome threshold.


 E_debris = debris_density × average_kinetic_energy × drag_factor × electromagnetic_factor

 Where:
	•	debris_density: total cross-sectional junk area per volume shell
	•	drag_factor: based on thermospheric energy
	•	electromagnetic_factor: charge variance × B-field strength

Make E_debris respond to:
	•	Solar storms (charging and EMP)
	•	Atmospheric energy (drag)
	•	Magnetic weakening (longer-lived charging effects)
	•	Oceanic phase delays (indirect, via atmospheric flow changes)

And then couple E_debris BACK into CEED:

resonance_coupling += gamma * E_debris * coupling_matrix[i][j]
